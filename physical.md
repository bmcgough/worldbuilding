# Describe the World

## How is it different than Earth?
Many worlds are similar to Earth; we are most comfortable thinking of ourselves and our characters existing in a reality much like our own.

If this is the case for your world, perhaps briefly describing the ways in which your world is different from Earth is faster and easier.

Many worlds are made for characters and stories that remain on a planet, and more often a single continent.

In other cases, the "world" is larger than a single planet. Think of that larger context for the rest of this document and imagine things one step "larger."

### Basics
Describe differences in size, gravity, pressure, atmosphere, presense of water, climate, seasons, moons, geography, etc.

Some basic questions:

 - Is the world about the same size as Earth? A similar distance from a simliar star? If not, you will need to consider gravity, climate, and atmosphere differences
 - Is there a moon? More than one? This will affect tides and the development of life on the world.
 - Are there more or fewer than four seasons? Think of Earth, where there are one to four seasons depending on your latitude. This affects culture and agriculture.
 - Is there a water cycle in the atmosphere? This can affect geography and agriculture.

### History
Describe differences in the development of the planet, the atmosphere, and life.

Some development questions:

 - Did life evolve on your world, or was it created? This does not dictate what your cultures may think about the origins of life, but may be good for you to know.
 - Have there been similar geologic ages to Earth? Similar material make-up? Balances of elements?
 - Did life on your world include branches of life that didn't last? Mass extinctions? Ice ages? These decisions affect the geography of the world.
 - Are there fossils? What kinds of ancient life existed? How did life begin and end up with whatever mixture of species you have on the world "today?"
